    <p>To the hiring personnel @ IQGeo.</p>

    <p>
      Hi, I describe myself as someone passionate about technology, coding and problem-solving. I am also pretty good
      at picking up on new technologies while understanding its origins and motivations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am based in Denver CO with Permanent Resident status.
    </p>
    </p>
      For the last 10+ years I have worked as a developer and integration specialist for Nokia.
      I've collaborated first hand in the transition of products and services from monoliths deployed on
      JEE containers/servers over virtual environments all the way to microservices deployed and maintained
      with Kubernetes and istio service mesh. Not to mention the CI/CD evolution along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year, I finished an MCS in Data Science at the University of Illinois to expand my skills
      out of my current professional domain. This was very beneficial for various reasons, namely, managing
      data and creating data pipelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      In relation to the job position, I have 5+ years of experienced in developing and maintaining microservices, from
      creating/changing the corresponding docker files, creating and maintaining helm charts all the way to deploy
      them over kubernetes and istio using mostly bash, Python and Ansible.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, I do not have much experience with Mobile applications. But, I have excellent learning skills.
      I have also maintained a couple of React projects in the past. I am pretty sure I can get up to speed really
      fast given the opportunity. Furthermore, I do not believe that applying to jobs where I cover all the checkboxes
      would put me in the path for growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, please consider my skills ranking below. I try to be very honest on the percentage of knowledge. I
      believe just a few people can say to know 100% of any technology, that is different from the capacity to extend
      that knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
