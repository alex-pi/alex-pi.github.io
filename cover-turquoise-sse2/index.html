    <p>To the hiring personnel @ Turquoise Health.</p>

    <p>
      Hi, I describe myself as someone passionate about technology, coding and problem-solving. I am also pretty good
      at picking up on new technologies while understanding its origins and motivations.
    <p>
    </p>
    For the last 10+ years I have worked as a developer and integration specialist for Nokia.
    I've collaborated first hand  in the transition of products and services from monoliths deployed on
    JEE containers/servers over virtual environments all the way to microservices deployed and maintained
    with Kubernetes and istio service mesh. Not to mention the CI/CD evolution along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just last year I finished an MCS in Data Science at the University of Illinois to expand my skills
      out of my current professional domain. I gained skills that have been very valuable for data manipulation
      using tools like numpy and pandas.

      During my studies I took a Deep learning for healthcare class that I believe can be relevant to this
      position. Here is a presentation about it:
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QIvIKVMm1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Personalized Clinical Feature Embedding.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      My experience with Python was originally only for integration and configuration on Linux systems along with Bash
      scripting. Later I moved to maintain and develop microservices based mostly on Django and FastAPI. Although
      my working experienced at that point had been mostly on Java and Spring portfolio I had no issues when
      I had to move to Python frameworks. There are conceptual parallels that help me along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am sure I can be of great value to the company given my combination of software development experience
      and knowledge of Data Science tooling and concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, please consider my skills ranking below. I try to be very honest on the percentage of knowledge. I
      believe just a few people can say to know 100% of any technology, that is different from the capacity to extend
      that knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
