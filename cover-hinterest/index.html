    <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>

    <p>
      I describe myself as someone passionate about technology, coding and problem-solving. I excel at quickly
      learning new technologies while understanding their origins and motivations. As a software engineer I
      specialized in backend systems, but I do have prior experienced on the front end as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a Bachelor degree on Computer Science and just last year I finished a Master's degree in Computer Science
      with a focus on Data Science at the University of Illinois to expand my skills out of my current professional domain.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the last 10 years I have worked as a developer and integration specialist for Nokia.
      I've collaborated firsthand  in the transition of products and services from monoliths deployed on
      JEE containers/servers over virtual environments all the way to microservices deployed and maintained
      with Kubernetes and Istio service mesh. Not to mention the CI/CD evolution along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The telecom-related projects I have worked on demanded quick response and good debugging skills of productive
      environments to allow service continuity. This is a skill I am sure I can provide great value with.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, I am looking for a new opportunity where I can help a team build software that matters. The 401(k)
      domain is both fascinating and highly impactful, and I am eager to contribute to it
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, I am eager to explore this new business domain and excited about the opportunity to learn and contribute.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
