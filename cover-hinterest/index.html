    <p>To the hiring personnel,</p>

    <p>
      Hi, I describe myself as someone passionate about technology, coding and problem-solving. I am also pretty good
      at picking up on new technologies while understanding its origins and motivations. As a software engineer I
      specialized on backend systems, but I do have prior experienced on the front end as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a Bachelor degree on Computer Science and just last year I finished a Masters in Computer Science on
      Data Science at the University of Illinois to expand my skills out of my current professional domain.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the last 10 years I have worked as a developer and integration specialist for Nokia.
      I've collaborated first hand  in the transition of products and services from monoliths deployed on
      JEE containers/servers over virtual environments all the way to microservices deployed and maintained
      with Kubernetes and istio service mesh. Not to mention the CI/CD evolution along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The telecom related projects I have worked on demanded quick response and good debugging skills of productive
      environments to allow service continuity. This is a skill I am sure I can provide great value with.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, I am looking for a new opportunity where I can help a team building software that matters. The 401(k)
      domain sounds very interesting to me and of great importance for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, it is exciting for me to jump into a new business domain such as this. I am very excited on learning
      about it given the opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
