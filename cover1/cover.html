    <p>To the hiring personnel,</p>

    <p>
      Hi, I describe myself as someone passionate about technology, coding and problem-solving. I am also pretty good
      at picking up on new technologies while understanding its origins and motivations.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the last 10 years I have worked as a developer for Nokia, where I've seen and experienced first hand
      the transition of products and services from monoliths deployed on JEE containers/servers over virtualized
      environments all the way to microservices deployed and maintained with Kubernetes and istio. Not to mention
      the CI/CD evolution along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, I recently left my job and started looking for opportunities as a freelancer. Last year I finished
      an MCS in Data Science to expand my skills a bit more.
    </p>

    <p>
      This job description picked my eye because it sounds like a good balance between things I have solid experience
      with and things I can improve on. For instance, I have only maintained a React code base
      project. I have not really created a full app with it, but my previous experience with JavaScript allow me to approach such
      front end libraries. On the flip side, over the last 4 years I have worked a lot with kubernetes and microservices integration with
      istio as a service mesh, as well as writing REST API clients/servers using just plain python or django in some cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, I am sure I can contribute to the project given the opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application</p>
