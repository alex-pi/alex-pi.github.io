    <p>To the hiring personnel,</p>

    <p>
      Hi, I describe myself as someone passionate about technology, coding and problem-solving. I am also pretty good
      at picking up on new technologies while understanding its origins and motivations.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the last 10 years I have worked as a developer and Integration Specialist for Nokia,
      where I've seen and experienced first hand the transition of products and services from monoliths deployed on
      JEE containers/servers over virtualized environments all the way to microservices deployed and maintained
      with Kubernetes and istio. Not to mention the CI/CD evolution along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, last year I finished an MCS in Data Science at the University of Illinois to expand my skills
      on this domain.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe to be a great fit for this job since I have over 10 years of experience developing Java based applications
      and services. Over the last 5 years I have worked as a Integration Specialist where part of my responsibilities
      have been writing REST API clients/servers using just plain python where dependencies are restricted or django
      and Spring Boot (MVC) in other cases. This is in the context of integrating/exposing/consuming data
      via REST APIs for microservices over Kubernetes and Istio service mesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, I am sure I can contribute to the project given the opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
