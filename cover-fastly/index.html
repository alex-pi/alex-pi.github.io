    <p>To the hiring personnel @ Fastly.</p>

    <p>
      Hi, I describe myself as someone passionate about technology, coding and problem-solving. I am also pretty good
      at picking up on new technologies while understanding its origins and motivations.
    <p>
    </p>
      For the last 10+ years I have worked as a developer and integration specialist for Nokia.
      I've collaborated first hand  in the transition of products and services from monoliths deployed on
      JEE containers/servers over virtual environments all the way to microservices deployed and maintained
      with Kubernetes and istio service mesh. Not to mention the CI/CD evolution along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just last year I finished an MCS in Data Science at the University of Illinois to expand my skills
      out of my current professional domain. I gained skills that have been very valuable for data manipulation
      using tools like numpy and pandas.
    </p>

    <p>
      In relation to the job position, I have 5+ years of experienced in developing and maintaining microservices, from
      creating/changing the corresponding docker files, creating and maintaining helm charts all the way to deploy
      them over kubernetes and istio using mostly bash, Python and Ansible. I have also created various Grafana dashboards
      for product metrics in the context of Telecom systems for Verizon.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, I do not have much experience with GoLang (except for the templates inside helm charts). Despite that,
      I have excellent learning skills when it comes to programming languages. I am pretty sure I can get up to
      speed really fast given the opportunity. Also, I do not believe that applying to jobs where I cover all the
      checkboxes would put me in the path for growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, please consider my skills ranking below. I try to be very honest on the percentage of knowledge. I
      believe just a few people can say to know 100% of any technology, that is different from the capacity to extend
      that knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
