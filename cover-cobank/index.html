    <p>To the hiring personnel,</p>

    <p>
      Hi, I describe myself as someone passionate about technology, coding and problem-solving. I am also pretty good
      at picking up on new technologies while understanding its origins and motivations.

      Just last year I finished an MCS in Data Science at the University of Illinois to expand my skills
      out of my current professional domain.

      Currently, I am studying to become an AWS Certified Solutions Architect.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the last 10 years I have worked as a developer and integration specialist for Nokia.
      I've collaborated first hand  in the transition of products and services from monoliths deployed on
      JEE containers/servers over virtual environments all the way to microservices deployed and maintained
      with Kubernetes and istio service mesh. Not to mention the CI/CD evolution along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      The telecom related projects I have worked on demanded quick response and good debugging skills of productive
      environments to allow service continuity. This is a skill I am sure I can provide great value with.
    </p>

    <p>
      This job description picked my eye because it sounds like a good balance between things I have solid experience
      with and things I can improve on. For instance, I have only maintained a React code base
      project, but my previous experiences with other JavaScript libraries allow me to approach such technologies.

      On the flip side, over the last 4 years I have worked authoring docker images and helm charts to be deployed
      on kubernetes as well as related automation using Python, Bash and Ansible playbooks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, it is exciting for me to jump into a new business domain such as banking. I have had experienced in
      banking, but all has been with banks located in Mexico and Spain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, I am sure I can contribute to the project given the opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application.</p>
